        <h2>School Goals</h2>
        <p>I'm a first-year Master's student in the School of Information with a focus on UX Research & Design. It is the third week of classes and I've been busy applying to student organizations, career events, and clubs. My goal is to strengthen my networking skills and thoroughly prepare for career fairs and interviews this semester. Next step afterwards is to have a finalized resume and be ready for design interviews.</p>
